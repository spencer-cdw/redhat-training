# NIceness


### Range

-20 (increased priority)
+19 (decreased priority)

Users can decrease their own priority, but only root can increase it.

Nice values map to a priority value, and both values are available for viewing in process listing commands. A nice value of -20 maps to a 0 priority in the top command. A nice value of 19 maps to a 39 priority in the top command.
