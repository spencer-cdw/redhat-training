# File descriptors 

`> 2 /dev/null`

```
> foo 2>&1 foo.log #write both stdout and stderr to foo.log
&> foo.log #write both stdout and stderr to foo.log
```

```bash
&> file
> file 2>&1
```


## Pipline

when combining redirection and pipelineing, the shell setsup the entire pipeline first, then redirects output. 

for example the following will not work because 'less' does not receive the output

```
 ls > /tmp/saved-output | less
```

### Tee

Tee overcomes this copying its standard input to its standard output. 

```
ls -l | tee /tmp/foobar | less
```

The reason why you might want to use `tee` at the end is that is shows what it is writing to a file as it saves.
